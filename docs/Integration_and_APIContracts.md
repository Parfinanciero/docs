# Integration and API Contracts

Effective integration is critical to the success of Parfinanciero. This document outlines the guidelines and standards for integrating the various microservices and establishing clear API contracts to ensure seamless communication across the platform.

## Integration Strategy

- **Modular Development:**  
  Each microservice (e.g., Expense Tracking, AI Projections, Business Intelligence, etc.) is developed independently.
  
- **Defined API Contracts:**  
  All inter-service communications are governed by well-documented API contracts. These contracts specify:
  - Endpoint URLs and HTTP methods.
  - Request parameters and payload structures.
  - Response formats, including error codes and messages.
  
- **Versioning:**  
  APIs should be versioned to ensure backward compatibility and to support iterative improvements without disrupting existing integrations.

- **Security Considerations:**  
  - All endpoints are secured using JWT for authentication and authorization.
  - Sensitive data is transmitted over HTTPS to ensure data privacy and integrity.

## API Documentation

- **Swagger/OpenAPI:**  
  Each service must maintain up-to-date Swagger/OpenAPI documentation accessible to all development teams. This ensures transparency and facilitates rapid troubleshooting and integration testing.
  
- **Endpoint Examples:**  
  Provide sample requests and responses for key endpoints to help developers understand the expected interactions. Examples should include:
  - **Request:** HTTP method, endpoint URL, and sample payload.
  - **Response:** HTTP status codes and JSON response examples.

## Integration Best Practices

- **Consistent Error Handling:**  
  Establish uniform error codes and messages across services to simplify debugging and improve user experience.
  
- **Testing and Validation:**  
  Each microservice must implement unit and integration tests to ensure API reliability. A minimum test coverage of 60% is required.
  
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**  
  Automated pipelines should enforce API contract compliance and run regression tests whenever changes are introduced.

## Coordination and Communication

- **Inter-Team Collaboration:**  
  Regular integration meetings should be held to align on API standards and to resolve any discrepancies between service contracts.
  
- **Change Management:**  
  Any modifications to the API contracts must be communicated in advance and documented clearly to prevent integration issues.

By adhering to these guidelines, Parfinanciero ensures that all services interact reliably and securely, providing a consistent and robust user experience across the entire platform.
