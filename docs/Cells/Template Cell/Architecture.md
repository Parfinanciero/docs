## `Architecture.md` â€“ Diagram, Technologies, and Internal Data Flows

**Purpose:**  
Detail the technical architecture of your service.

**What to include:**

- **Architectural Diagram:**  
  Provide a diagram (or a link to one) that visually represents the architecture. This should include major components, data flow, and how the service interacts with other parts of the system.
  
- **Technologies and Frameworks:**  
  List all technologies used (e.g., Spring Boot, Python for AI Projections, React, etc.) and any libraries or frameworks that are integral to the service.
  
- **Internal Data Flows:**  
  Explain how data is processed within the service. Detail input, processing steps, storage, and output.
  
- **Design Decisions:**  
  Briefly discuss why certain technologies or architectures were chosen.

*Example Content:*
> "The Expense Tracking service is built using Spring Boot. Data is received via RESTful endpoints, processed, and then stored in PostgreSQL for structured records and MongoDB for unstructured data. The service also exposes APIs that other services can consume."
