## üìù 2. Introduction

### üìå Context and Justification

The digital transformation and the growing reliance on online financial services have created the need for more secure and efficient authentication systems. Traditional authentication solutions based on static credentials have proven to be vulnerable to attacks such as phishing, brute force, and identity theft. As a comprehensive financial management platform, Parfinanciero requires a robust mechanism that ensures both security and accessibility for its users.

In this context, integrating an authentication system based on OAuth 2.0 with Google and Microsoft represents a modern solution that minimizes security risks and enhances the user experience. Additionally, using JWT tokens enables secure communication between the platform‚Äôs microservices, ensuring efficient session and user permission management.

### ‚ùì Problem Description

Financial platforms must ensure that only legitimate users can access sensitive information and perform secure operations. However, traditional systems present several challenges:

- **Authentication Vulnerabilities:** Traditional methods such as static passwords can be easily compromised.
- **User Experience Friction:** Users often forget passwords or use insecure combinations, complicating authentication.
- **Integration Difficulties with Other Services:** Without a centralized authentication system, each service must implement its own validation rules.
- **Inefficient Session Management:** Without a standardized session management mechanism, users may experience unexpected logouts or unauthorized access.
